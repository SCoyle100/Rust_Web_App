***Understanding mod.rs***

<u>Purpose:</u> The mod.rs file is used to represent a module that is a directory. It allows you to define a module within a directory of the same name. For example, if you have a directory named network, placing a file named mod.rs inside it tells Rust that this directory is a module named network.

<u>Contents:</u> This mod.rs file typically contains module-level declarations, sub-module includes, and other code relevant to that module. It might also declare sub-modules which can be other files or directories within the same directory.

<u>Alternatives to mod.rs:</u>
With more recent editions of Rust (starting from the 2018 edition), you can also define modules using a different convention where you simply name the file after the module itself with a .rs extension. For example, instead of having a network/mod.rs, you could have a network.rs in the parent directory, and then use directories for sub-modules if needed. This sometimes leads to a clearer project structure and avoids deep nesting of mod.rs files.

<u>Using super::super::</u>
When you use super::super:: in your Rust code, you are moving up two levels in the module hierarchy. Here's what it means:

<u>super:</u> References the parent module of the current module.
super::super: References the grandparent module of the current module.
Whether this reaches a mod.rs file depends on the structure of your project. If each level of your module hierarchy corresponds to a directory with a mod.rs, then super::super:: would indeed refer to the mod.rs of the grandparent module. However, if you are using the alternative file structure (like network.rs at the root of the network directory), then it might refer to another appropriately named .rs file.

In summary, while mod.rs is a common and recognized way to structure modules in directories, the exact file reached by super::super:: depends on how your project's modules are organized.
