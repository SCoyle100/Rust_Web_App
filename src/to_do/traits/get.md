*Method Definition (get):*

The get method is defined with the following parameters:

&self: Indicates that this method is called on an instance of a type that implements this trait. It doesn't modify the instance, as it only references self.
title: &String: A reference to a string that acts as the key in the JSON object (state).
state: &Map<String, Value>: A reference to a read-only Map that holds key-value pairs where the keys are strings and values are JSON values.
Inside the method:
let item: Option<&Value> = state.get(title);: This line attempts to retrieve a value from the state map using the key provided by title. The get method returns an Option<&Value>, which will be Some(&Value) if the key exists, or None if it does not.
match item { ... }: This match statement is used to handle the Option returned by state.get(title). Here's what happens in each case:
Some(result) => { ... }: If the item is found (Some case), it executes the block of code within the braces. This block prints the title of the item and its associated status (the value from the map). result is a reference to the value associated with title.
None => { ... }: If the item is not found (None case), a message is printed indicating that the item with the specified title was not found.
