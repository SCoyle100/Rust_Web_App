*Method Definition (create):*

The create method is defined with four parameters:

**&self:** Implies that this method is called on instances of types implementing this trait.

**title: &String:** A reference to a string that presumably acts as a title or key.

**status: &String:** A reference to another string that represents some status or value associated with the title.

**state: &mut Map<String, Value>:** A mutable reference to a Map (a JSON object), where the method will store or update data.



*Inside the method:*

**state.insert(title.to_string(), json!(status)):** This line inserts a new key-value pair into the state JSON object. The key is a string derived from title, and the value is a JSON representation of status. The json! macro converts the status string into a JSON Value.

write_to_file("./state.json", state): Calls the write_to_file function, passing a file path and the modified state map. This function serializes the state map to JSON and writes it to the file specified.

println!("\n\n{} is being created\n\n", title): Outputs a message to the console indicating that an item with the given title is being created.
